# **Status:** In Progress

# Project Overview: create a recommendation system using videos from YouTube.com
# Final product: recommentation video system hosted on a cloud service 

**Key steps to be noticed:**
 - add a threshold or videos ranking.
 - the final product will be a web app with videos links.
 - add and evaluate metrics to the problem:
   - 1st metric: from the top N videos, how many videos the user will be added to the list to be watched later?
   - 2nd metric: how long the video needs to be to be selected?

Possible issues:
 - feature noises: how long the user will take to select a video?
   This time may be correlated with the recommendation system.


Possible questions to be asked:
- choice the 'correct' problem'. Is it feasiable? Can it be done in a short period of time?
- minimum features required: videos attributes and a label. Are the features valuable?
- simple search query that contain - machine, learning, kaggle, and data science. Would be the sufficient to predict to recommend new videos with a high prediction score?

# Project in a nutshell

1. Problem well defined:
  - Streamline the time to select a video to watch using key words on You Tube.
  - Automated process to avoid seaching for new videos.
  - Use Data Science techniques be used to solve this problem.
  - Deploty the final solution in production, cloud enviroment.
