# **Status:** In Progress

# Project Overview: create a recommendation system using videos from YouTube.com
# Final product: recommentation video system hosted on a cloud servive 

**Key steps to be noticed:**
 - add a threshold or videos ranking.
 - final production in a Production environment should be a web app of the the videos links and  and all videos ordered.
 - add and evaluate metrics to the problem:
   - 1st metric: from the top N videos, how many videos the user will be added to the list to be watched later.
   - 2nd metric: how long the video needs to be to be selected?

Possible issues:
 - feature noises: how long the user will take to select a video?
   This time may be correlated with the recommendation system.


Possible questions to be asked:
- choice the 'correct' problem'. Is it feasiable? Can it be done in a short period of time?
- please choice a simple problem: sale raising, time series(prevision, cancellation)
- minimum features required: videos attributes and a label
- few features to start from Zero: search queries that contain - machine, learning, kaggle, data science
